    "skill_centroidOfTriangle": "When to use: When dealing with balancing points or average positions within a triangle, especially in physics problems involving moments or centroids, or in computer graphics and geometry problems requiring center of mass. This skill is essential for static equilibrium calculations, design software, and statistical averages over triangular regions. Step-by-step: 1) Understand that the centroid of a triangle divides each median in a 2:1 ratio, with the longer segment adjacent to the vertex. The centroid is the intersection point of the three medians. 2) For each vertex, locate the midpoint of the opposite side.

These medians will intersect at the centroid. 4) The centroid's coordinates can be calculated as the average of the coordinates of the triangle's vertices. Specifically, if the vertices are (x₁, y₁), (x₂, y₂), and (x₃, y₃), then the centroid is at ((x₁+x₂+x₃)/3, (y₁+y₂+y₃)/3). 5) If only a rough estimate is needed, understand that the centroid is always inside the triangle and closer to the heavier concentrations of the triangle's area.
