  "problem": "The $9$ members of a baseball team went to an ice-cream parlor after their game. Each player had a single scoop cone of chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry ice cream. At least one player chose each flavor, and the number of players who chose chocolate was greater than the number of players who chose vanilla, which was greater than the number of players who chose strawberry. Let $N$ be the number of different assignments of flavors to players that meet these conditions. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$",

    "skill_countingCombinationsWithConstraints": "When to use: When counting the number of ways to distribute items with specific constraints, such as limited quantities per category or ordering requirements. This skill is applicable in combinatorics and probability problems where direct enumeration might be tedious. Step-by-step: 1) Define the problem clearly, identifying the total number of items and the categories they belong to. 2) Establish the constraints, such as minimum or maximum numbers per category. 3) Use combinatorial principles, including combinations with repetition, inclusion-exclusion, or generating functions, depending on the complexity. 4) Break down the problem into smaller subproblems if necessary, handling one constraint at a time. 5) Multiply the number of ways for each independent subproblem to get the total number of valid distributions. 6) Adjust for overlaps or dependencies between constraints if present. 7) Verify the solution by testing against known cases or simulating smaller versions of the problem. Key insights: Breaking down the problem into manageable parts helps avoid overcounting or undercounting. Using generating functions can simplify counting problems with multiple constraints."
