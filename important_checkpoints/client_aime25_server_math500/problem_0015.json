    "skill_modularAnalysis": "When to use: Modular arithmetic is essential for problems involving divisibility, remainders, and periodic phenomena. It helps in breaking down complex problems into more manageable parts by focusing on remainders upon division. This technique is widely used in number theory, cryptography, coding theory, and solving Diophantine equations. Step-by-step: 1) Identify the modulus relevant to the problem, typically denoted as 'n' in the expression a ≡ b mod n. 2) Understand that modular arithmetic deals with equivalence classes of integers based on their remainders when divided by 'n'. 3) Classify each component (numbers, variables, exponents) based on their residues modulo 'n', reducing complexity by grouping similar behaviors together. 4) Utilize properties of modular arithmetic such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation rules to manipulate the problem. 5) Consider the periodic nature of residues, allowing repetition of patterns every 'n' units. 6) Translate real-world problems into mathematical models using modular arithmetic, identifying quantities, constraints, and desired outcomes. 7) Solve the transformed problem using modular arithmetic techniques, ensuring all steps respect the modulus. 8) Interpret the results back in the context of the original problem to provide meaningful conclusions. Key insights: Modular arithmetic simplifies complex number relationships by focusing on cyclical patterns. It enables systematic reduction of problems and leverages inherent symmetries for elegant solutions.",
    "skill_recursiveExtension": "When to use: Recursive methods are ideal for problems that can be broken down into smaller, identical subproblems. They are commonly applied in mathematics, computer science, and algorithm design where a problem size can be reduced proportionally at each step until reaching a trivial solution. Step-by-step: 1) Define the base case(s) of the recursion - the smallest version of the problem that can be solved directly. 2) Establish the recursive relation that expresses the solution of a problem size 'n' in terms of solutions of smaller sizes, typically 'n-1' or 'n/k' for some integer k>1. 3) Decompose the problem into one or more smaller subproblems, ensuring each decomposition maintains the problem's essence and moves towards the base case. 4) Combine the solutions of the subproblems, possibly through iterative combination or applying transformations, to construct the solution for the current problem size. 5) Repeat the decomposition and combination steps until reaching the initial problem size. 6) Optimize the recursion by memoization or dynamic programming if computational efficiency is a concern, avoiding redundant calculations. 7) Validate the correctness of the recursive approach by testing it against known solutions or edge cases. 8) Analyze the time and space complexity to ensure feasibility for desired input sizes. Key insights: Recursion breaks down complex tasks into simpler components, making them easier to handle. It relies on understanding the problem's structure and expressing it in terms of smaller versions of itself. Recursive algorithms often balance between simplicity and efficiency, requiring careful definition of base cases and recursive steps."
