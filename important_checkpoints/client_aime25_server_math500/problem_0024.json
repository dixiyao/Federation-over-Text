    "skill_n_tangentPoints": "When to use: To find points where a function is tangent to the x-axis, you need to determine where both the function and its derivative equal zero. This is essential for identifying double roots or points where the graph touches the axis without crossing it. Step-by-step: 1) First, set the function equal to zero and solve for x-values where f(x)=0. This typically involves analyzing trigonometric equations, absolute values, or polynomial roots. 2) Next, compute the derivative of the function to determine where the slope is zero. This step may involve applying rules of differentiation, such as the chain rule, product rule, or quotient rule depending on the complexity of the function. 3) After obtaining the derivative, set it equal to zero and solve for x-values where f'(x)=0. 4) Now, find the intersection of the solutions obtained from f(x)=0 and f'(x)=0. These are the points where both the function and its derivative are zero, indicating tangency to the x-axis. 5) Verify each candidate point by substituting back into both the function and its derivative to ensure they meet the criteria. Key insights: Identifying tangency points combines knowledge of both function behavior and its rate of change. It's crucial to accurately solve the equations and verify solutions to avoid missing or incorrectly including non-tangency points."
