  "problem": "In $\\triangle ABC$ points $D$ and $E$ lie on $\\overline{AB}$ so that $AD < AE < AB$, while points $F$ and $G$ lie on $\\overline{AC}$ so that $AF < AG < AC$. Suppose $AD = 4$, $DE = 16$, $EB = 8$, $AF = 13$, $FG = 52$, and $GC = 26$. Let $M$ be the reflection of $D$ through $F$, and let $N$ be the reflection of $G$ through $E$. The area of quadrilateral $DEGF$ is $288$. Find the area of heptagon $AFNBCEM$.",

    "skill_quadraticEquationSolving": "When to use: When trying to find roots of quadratic equations. Step-by-step: 1) Write the equation in standard form ax² + bx + c = 0. 2) Compute the discriminant D = b² - 4ac. 3) If D > 0, there are two real solutions; if D = 0, one real solution; if D < 0, no real solutions. 4) Apply quadratic formula x = [-b ± √D]/(2a). 5) Simplify the expression under the root and solve for x. 6) Check solutions by substitution back into original equation.",
    "skill_shoelaceFormula": "When to use: When calculating the area of a polygon given the coordinates of its vertices. Step-by-step: 1) List the coordinates of each vertex in order, either clockwise or counter-clockwise, repeating the first vertex at the end to close the polygon. 2) Multiply each x-coordinate by the y-coordinate of the next vertex, sum all these products. 3) Multiply each y-coordinate by the x-coordinate of the next vertex, sum all these products. 4) Subtract the second sum from the first sum and take the absolute value. 5) Divide the result by 2 to obtain the area. 6) Ensure that the polygon does not intersect itself and that all vertices are accounted for accurately. Key insights: The shoelace formula provides a reliable method for area calculation once coordinates are known, avoiding the need for manual grid counting."
