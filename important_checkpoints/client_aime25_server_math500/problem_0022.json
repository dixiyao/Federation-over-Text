The probability that $B$ is a nonempty set with the property that the least common multiple of its element is $2025$ is $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.

    "skill_inclusionExclusionPrinciple": "{'When to use': 'When solving combinatorial problems where you need to count the number of elements in a union of sets, especially when direct enumeration is difficult or impossible. This principle helps avoid double-counting or missing elements by systematically adding and subtracting intersections.', 'Step-by-step': [\"1) Identify the universal set and the subsets involved in the problem. Understand what each subset represents in terms of the problem's requirements.\", '2) Break down the problem into smaller parts by considering each subset individually. For example, define A_i as the ith subset of interest.', '3) Compute the cardinality (size) of each individual subset A_i.', '4) Compute the size of all possible intersections of these subsets, starting with pairwise intersections, then triples, and so on.', '5) Apply the inclusion-exclusion formula iteratively: Start with the sum of sizes of individual subsets, subtract the sum of sizes of all pairwise intersections, add the sum of sizes of all triple-wise intersections, continue alternating addition and subtraction until all relevant intersections are considered.', '6) The final result is the exact count of elements belonging to at least one of the subsets.', 'Key insights: This principle is essential for accurately counting unions of sets without overcounting or undercounting. It requires careful identification of all relevant subsets and their intersections to ensure precise results.']}",

For GCD, take the lowest power.', '6) Prime factorization is invaluable in cryptography, number theory, and algorithm optimization, making it a cornerstone of modern mathematics.', 'Key insights: Prime factorization provides the building blocks of integers, essential for analyzing their structural properties and relationships. It is a powerful tool for reducing complex problems into manageable components based on prime components.']}"
