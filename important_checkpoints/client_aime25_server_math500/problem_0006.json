    "skill_tangentialQuadrilateralProperties": "When to use: When dealing with a quadrilateral that has an inscribed circle (tangent to all four sides), this skill helps derive relationships between side lengths and other properties. It is particularly useful for problems involving perimeters, areas, or radii associated with the incircle. Step-by-step: 1) Recognize that the quadrilateral is tangential; thus, the sum of the lengths of the two opposite sides are equal. This comes from the property that in a tangential quadrilateral, the sums of both pairs of opposite sides are equal. 2) Apply the formula that relates the area (A) of a tangential quadrilateral to its perimeter (P) and the radius (r) of the incircle: A = P * r / 2. This formula is analogous to the area formula for a triangle, where the area is the product of the semi-perimeter and the inradius. 3) Calculate the semi-perimeter by adding all four sides and dividing by two. Alternatively, since in a tangential quadrilateral, the semi-perimeter can also be calculated as the sum of one pair of adjacent sides (since the other pair adds up to the same total). 4) Use the relationship between the sides and the semi-perimeter to set up equations necessary to solve for unknown side lengths. 5) Combine these equations with additional information from the problem, such as angles or diagonals, to solve for required variables. 6) Verify solutions by plugging back into the original problem or using cross-checking methods.
