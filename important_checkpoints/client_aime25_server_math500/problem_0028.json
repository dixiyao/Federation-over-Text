    "skill_fixedPointIteration": "When to use: When solving recursive sequences or iterative processes where each term is generated from the previous one, especially when seeking steady-state values or equilibrium points. This skill is particularly useful in numerical analysis and optimization problems where convergence to a fixed point is desired. Step-by-step: 1) Define the iterative formula clearly, ensuring it's well-behaved and bounded within realistic bounds 2) Choose an appropriate initial guess close to the suspected fixed point to accelerate convergence 3) Perform repeated applications of the formula, calculating successive terms until the values stabilize to the desired precision 4) Monitor for convergence by comparing successive terms and stopping when the difference falls below a predetermined tolerance threshold 5) Validate the result by checking against theoretical expectations or additional computational methods 6) Consider potential issues like divergence or cycling, adjusting parameters or choosing different methods if necessary 7) Document the process meticulously, keeping track of iterations, errors, and convergence rates. Key insights: Fixed-point iteration relies heavily on the choice of the initial guess and the nature of the function governing the iteration. The method is straightforward but requires careful handling to ensure convergence.",
    "skill_sequenceAnalysis": "When to use: When analyzing the behavior of recursive sequences, particularly those defined by iterative formulas, to determine their convergence, periodicity, or cyclical behavior. This skill is essential in mathematical analysis, computer algorithms, and dynamical systems studies where understanding long-term trends is critical. Step-by-step: 1) Write down the explicit formula for the sequence if available or derive it from the recursive definition 2) Analyze the form of the recursive formula to predict qualitative behavior - consider whether the sequence is increasing, decreasing, oscillating, or following some other pattern 3) Calculate initial terms to observe trends and estimate the limit 4) Apply analytical methods or fixed-point iteration to rigorously determine the limit or behavior 5) Utilize concepts like convergence tests, boundedness, and monotonicity to formally prove the sequence's behavior 6) Combine numerical experimentation with theoretical analysis to strengthen conclusions 7) Present findings in a structured manner, supported by calculations and logical deductions. Key insights: Understanding sequence behavior combines both empirical observation and theoretical proof, ensuring robust conclusions.",
    "skill_recurrenceRelationSolving": "When to use: When faced with a linear recurrence relation, particularly homogeneous ones with constant coefficients, to find an explicit formula for the nth term. This skill is fundamental in mathematics, computer science, and engineering for modeling phenomena like population growth, financial investments, and digital signal processing. Step-by-step: 1) Classify the recurrence as linear, homogeneous, with constant coefficients, and determine its order 2) Find the characteristic equation by assuming solutions of the form r^n 3) Solve the characteristic equation to obtain roots, which can be real or complex 4) Based on the nature of the roots, construct the general solution as a combination of exponential functions and/or trigonometric functions 5) Use initial conditions or other given information to solve for unknown coefficients in the general solution 6) Simplify the resulting expression to present it in its most compact form 7) Verify the solution by substituting it back into the original recurrence relation and confirming that both sides match perfectly. Key insights: Solving recurrence relations efficiently often hinges on accurately finding the roots of the characteristic equation and correctly combining them according to the nature of the roots.",
    "skill_fixedPointConvergenceAnalysis": "When to use: When determining whether a fixed point exists for a given function and analyzing its convergence properties. This skill is crucial in calculus, numerical analysis, and dynamical systems where understanding the behavior of iterative methods is essential. Step-by-step: 1) Establish the function f(x) for which you want to find fixed points 2) Graphically inspect f(x) and the line y=x to identify potential fixed points 3) Use the fixed-point theorem criteria to assess the existence and uniqueness of fixed points 4) Compute iterates starting from an initial guess to observe convergence behavior 5) Analyze the derivative of f at the fixed point to determine local convergence (contraction mapping principle) 6) If the derivative's absolute value is less than 1 near the fixed point, conclude that the fixed point is attracting 7) Otherwise, investigate if the fixed point is repelling or neutral and describe the behavior accordingly 8) Apply acceleration techniques like Aitken's delta-squared process or Steffensen's method if necessary to improve convergence 9) Document the convergence process, including error estimates and rates, to provide a comprehensive analysis. Key insights: The derivative test provides valuable information about the stability of fixed points, guiding the choice of initial guesses and iterative methods.",
    "skill_sequenceTransformation": "When to use: When transforming a complex recursive sequence into a simpler form that facilitates analysis or computation. This includes techniques like substitution, telescoping, or expressing terms in a different basis. Step-by-step: 1) Identify recurring elements or patterns within the sequence that suggest a beneficial transformation 2) Choose an appropriate substitution or transformation method - such as logarithmic, reciprocal, or linear transformations - to simplify the recursive relationship 3) Apply the transformation to each term of the sequence, deriving a new recursive formula that is easier to handle 4) Analyze the transformed sequence for simplicity or detect hidden structures like telescoping products or sums 5) Reverse the transformation to recover the original sequence's properties from the transformed version 6) Utilize the transformed sequence to compute limits, find closed-form expressions, or evaluate summations 7) Verify consistency by converting results back to the original sequence's context. Key insights: Transformations can reveal underlying structures not apparent in the original sequence, aiding in both theoretical and computational analyses."
