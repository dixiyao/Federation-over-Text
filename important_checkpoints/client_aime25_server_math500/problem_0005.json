    "skill_polynomialFactoring": "When to use: When solving equations with polynomial expressions that can be factored, especially when the polynomial has recognizable patterns like difference of squares (a²-b²), perfect square trinomials (a²±2ab+b²), or common factors. This skill is particularly useful for quadratic and higher-degree polynomial equations where factoring can simplify the problem. Step-by-step: 1) Examine the polynomial structure carefully to identify common patterns such as difference of squares where a²-b²=(a-b)(a+b), perfect square trinomials where a²+2ab+b²=(a+b)² or a²-2ab+b²=(a-b)², and common factors that can be factored out using the distributive property 2) Apply the appropriate factoring technique based on the identified pattern - for difference of squares use (a-b)(a+b), for perfect squares use (a±b)², and for common factors factor out the greatest common divisor 3) Set each factor equal to zero to create simpler equations that are easier to solve, using the zero product property which states that if ab=0 then either a=0 or b=0 4) Solve the resulting linear or quadratic equations using standard algebraic methods such as isolating the variable or applying the quadratic formula if needed 5) Verify all solutions by substituting them back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy the equation and check for extraneous solutions that may have been introduced. Key insights: Factoring reduces complex polynomials to simpler equations. Always look for patterns first before attempting brute force methods.",
    "skill_systematicSubstitution": "When to use: When dealing with systems of equations or complex expressions with multiple variables where one variable can be expressed in terms of others, making the problem more manageable. This approach is especially effective when one equation is already solved for a variable or can be easily rearranged. Step-by-step: 1) Identify which variable to substitute by finding the simplest relationship - look for equations where one variable is already isolated or can be easily isolated, prefer variables with coefficient 1 or -1 2) Express one variable in terms of others from one equation - solve for the chosen variable explicitly, ensuring the expression is valid for all values in the domain 3) Substitute this expression into other equations in the system, replacing all instances of the substituted variable with the expression, being careful to maintain parentheses when the expression contains multiple terms 4) Simplify the resulting equation(s) to reduce the number of variables and create a more solvable form, combining like terms and applying algebraic operations 5) Solve for the remaining variable(s) using appropriate algebraic techniques such as isolating the variable or applying the quadratic formula if needed 6) Back-substitute to find the values of all variables by plugging the solved values back into the substitution expression, working backwards through the system 7) Verify the solution satisfies all original equations by checking each equation with the found values, ensuring no arithmetic errors were made. Key insights: Substitution reduces multi-variable problems to single-variable problems. Choose the substitution that simplifies the most complex parts first."
