  "problem": "The set of points in $3$-dimensional coordinate space that lie in the plane $x+y+z=75$ whose coordinates satisfy the inequalities\\[x-yz<y-zx<z-xy\\]forms three disjoint convex regions. Exactly one of those regions has finite area. The area of this finite region can be expressed in the form $a\\sqrt{b},$ where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers and $b$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $a+b.$",

    "skill_description": "When to use: When solving equations with polynomial expressions that can be factored, especially when the polynomial has recognizable patterns like difference of squares (a² - b²), perfect square trinomials (a² ± 2ab + b²), or common factors. This skill is particularly useful for quadratic and higher-degree polynomial equations where factoring can simplify the problem. Step-by-step: 1) Examine the polynomial structure carefully to identify common patterns such as difference of squares where a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b), perfect square trinomials where a² + 2ab + b² = (a + b)² or a² - 2ab + b² = (a - b)², and common factors that can be factored out using the distributive property. 2) Apply the appropriate factoring technique based on the identified pattern: for difference of squares, use (a - b)(a + b); for perfect squares, use (a ± b)²; and for common factors, factor out the greatest common divisor. 3) Set each factor equal to zero to create simpler equations that are easier to solve, using the zero product property which states that if ab = 0 then either a = 0 or b = 0. 4) Solve the resulting linear or quadratic equations using standard algebraic methods such as isolating the variable or applying the quadratic formula if needed. 5) Verify all solutions by substituting them back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy the equation and check for extraneous solutions that may have been introduced. Key insights: Factoring reduces complex polynomials to simpler equations. Always look for patterns first before attempting brute force methods."
