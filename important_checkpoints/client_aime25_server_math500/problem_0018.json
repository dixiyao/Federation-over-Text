    "skill_description": "When to use: When solving combinatorial geometry problems where each element has a binary state (on/off, red/blue) and there are constraints on the number of active states in each region, especially in grid-based puzzles. This skill is particularly useful for problems where each face (square) must satisfy a specific condition, translating into linear constraints over GF(2). Step-by-step: 1) Model the problem as a graph where each edge is a variable (variable: edge color, domain: {red, blue}), each face (square) is a constraint (equation: sum of edge colors around the face equals a specific value, typically 2 for exactly two red edges), and the goal is to find all assignments of edge colors that satisfy all constraints. 2) Convert the problem into a system of linear equations over GF(2), where each equation represents a face's constraint, and each variable represents an edge. 3) Construct the system matrix where rows correspond to faces (squares) and columns correspond to edges, with entries indicating whether an edge is part of a face. 4) Perform Gaussian elimination over GF(2) to reduce the system to row-echelon form, determining the rank and nullity of the system. 5) The number of solutions is 2 raised to the power of the nullity, representing the degrees of freedom in assigning colors. 6) Interpret the solutions in terms of edge colorings, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied. Key insights: Linear algebra provides a systematic way to handle multiple constraints simultaneously. Working over GF(2) simplifies the problem by converting it into a linear system where each equation is a simple parity check. Gaussian elimination efficiently finds the solution space, revealing the number of valid configurations."
