    "skill_divisorAnalysis": "When to use: When seeking integer solutions within a range based on divisors, particularly when analyzing factors or multiples of numbers. This skill is crucial for problems involving divisibility, prime factors, or breaking down composite numbers into their component factors. Step-by-step: 1) Identify the target number for which you need to find divisors - determine whether it's necessary to include both positive and negative divisors or only positive ones based on context 2) List all possible divisors systematically, often starting from smallest absolute value upwards, considering both smaller and larger factors 3) For each divisor candidate, test its divisibility against the target number by performing division or applying modular arithmetic techniques 4) Record the valid divisors that successfully divide the target number without leaving a remainder 5) Once all relevant divisors are identified, apply additional analysis as required by the problem - such as selecting those within a specified range or satisfying particular properties 6) Use the identified divisors to derive further solutions or conclusions, keeping track of any restrictions or conditions imposed by the problem statement. Key insights: Divisor analysis helps in breaking down complex problems into simpler components. Starting with obvious divisors ensures comprehensive coverage without missing critical factors."
