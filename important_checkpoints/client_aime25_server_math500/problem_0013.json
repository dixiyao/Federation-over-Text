  "problem": "Alex divides a disk into four quadrants with two perpendicular diameters intersecting at the center of the disk. He draws $25$ more lines segments through the disk, drawing each segment by selecting two points at random on the perimeter of the disk in different quadrants and connecting these two points. Find the expected number of regions into which these $27$ line segments divide the disk.",

    "skill_linearityOfExpectation": "When to use: When calculating expected values in probability theory, especially when dealing with sums of random variables that contribute additive increments. This approach is particularly useful when each component's contribution can be analyzed independently of the others, allowing for simplified calculations. Step-by-step: 1) Break down the problem into individual components or trials that contribute to the overall outcome. In this case, each chord represents a trial that can increase the number of regions. 2) Determine the expected contribution of each individual component. Here, each chord's expected number of intersections with existing chords is calculated separately. 3) Sum the expected contributions of all components to find the total expected value. This relies on the principle that the expected value of a sum is the sum of the expected values, regardless of dependencies between the components. 4) Validate the calculation by ensuring that the contributions are correctly weighted and summed, and that no overlapping or interference between components is improperly accounted for. Key insights: Linearity of expectation allows for the decomposition of complex problems into manageable parts, simplifying the calculation significantly by ignoring dependencies between variables.",
    "skill_geometricProbability": "When to use: When dealing with geometric problems that involve random points, lengths, areas, or volumes, especially when determining probabilities of events such as intersections, containment, or distances between random elements. This is commonly encountered in problems involving circles, spheres, or convex shapes. Step-by-step: 1) Define the sample space and the event of interest clearly. In this problem, the event is a chord intersecting another chord. 2) Visualize the scenario geometrically or draw a diagram to understand spatial relationships. Here, imagining two chords intersecting within a circle helps grasp the concept. 3) Determine the measure of the favorable outcomes relative to the total possible outcomes. Calculate the probability by dividing the measure of favorable cases by the total measure. 4) Utilize symmetry, uniform distributions, or invariant properties to simplify the probability calculation. For example, recognizing that the orientation of chords does not affect the probability in a rotationally symmetric disk. 5) Apply known formulas or principles from geometric probability, such as Buffon's needle problem or Bertrand's paradox, depending on the specifics of the problem. 6) Combine individual probabilities or measures as needed to address compound events. In this case, integrating over all possible chord orientations to find the overall probability. 7) Verify the result by checking consistency with simpler cases or by performing numerical simulations if necessary. Key insights: Geometric probability bridges geometry and probability, offering a structured way to quantify uncertain spatial events by measuring favorable versus total possibilities.",
    "skill_recurrenceRelations": "When to use: When approaching problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems, where the solution to a larger problem depends on the solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. This is especially effective in algorithm design and mathematical analysis for sequences and series. Step-by-step: 1) Identify the base cases that can be solved directly without further subdivision. In this context, the base case is having four regions from the initial two diameters. 2) Express the problem size in terms of a smaller version, defining how the solution builds upon itself. Each additional chord introduces a dependency on the existing number of regions. 3) Formulate a recurrence relation that expresses the solution for size n in terms of solutions for sizes less than n. Here, each chord's addition relates to the previous number of chords and their intersections. 4) Solve the recurrence relation using methods suitable for the type of sequence it describes—such as characteristic equations for linear recurrences or iterative summation. 5) Validate the recurrence solution by testing it against known cases or by proving it mathematically. Key insights: Recurrence relations provide a systematic way to extend solutions incrementally, allowing for efficient computation of large instances based on smaller, manageable computations.",
    "skill_probabilityAndExpectation": "When to use: Whenever analyzing scenarios involving uncertainty, variability, or randomness, particularly when predicting the likelihood of events or estimating averages. This is fundamental in statistics, risk assessment, simulation, and optimization. Step-by-step: 1) Clearly define the random variable representing the quantity of interest—in this case, the number of regions created by the chords. 2) Identify all possible values the random variable can take and associate each with its probability. Here, each chord's contribution to the region count is quantified probabilistically. 3) Use the definition of expectation, multiplying each possible value by its probability and summing the results. This step involves summing over all possible outcomes weighted by their likelihoods. 4) Simplify the expectation calculation using properties such as linearity of expectation or known distributions. Here, recognizing that each chord's contribution is independent allows for easy summation. 5) Compute the final expected value, possibly using approximations or exact formulas depending on the complexity. 6) Interpret the result in the context of the problem, ensuring it aligns with intuitive understanding and sanity checks. Key insights: Understanding the expected value provides a central tendency measure that accounts for probabilistic variations, helping predict average outcomes in uncertain systems."
