  "problem": "The twelve letters $A$,$B$,$C$,$D$,$E$,$F$,$G$,$H$,$I$,$J$,$K$, and $L$ are randomly grouped into six pairs of letters. The two letters in each pair are placed next to each other in alphabetical order to form six two-letter words, and then those six words are listed alphabetically. For example, a possible result is $AB$, $CJ$, $DG$, $EK$, $FL$, $HI$. The probability that the last word listed contains $G$ is $\\frac mn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",

    "skill_namingConventions": "When to use: N/A. Step-by-step: 1) Identify the naming conventions used in the solution, noting how variables, functions, constants, and entities are referred to. 2) Assign consistent labels or symbols to named elements for clarity and ease of reference. 3) Document the conventions used in the solution to aid reproducibility and maintain consistency across similar problems.",
    "skill_combinationsAndOperations": "When to use: When performing operations that combine multiple mathematical concepts, such as addition, multiplication, exponents, or roots. This includes problems where multiple operations must be executed in a specific sequence. Step-by-step: 1) Break down the problem into individual operations, identifying each component to be combined. 2) Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) to determine the precedence of each operation. 3) Perform each operation sequentially, starting with parentheses/brackets, then exponents/orders, followed by multiplication/division, and finally addition/subtraction. 4) Combine intermediate results step by step, maintaining accuracy throughout the computation. 5) Check the final result against the expected outcome or perform inverse operations to verify correctness. Key insights: Proper sequencing of operations ensures accurate results. Misapplying the order of operations leads to incorrect answers.",
    "skill_permutationsAndCombinations": "When to use: When counting problems involve selecting items from a set where the order matters or where order does not matter. This includes problems requiring permutations for arrangements or combinations for selections. Step-by-step: 1) Determine whether the problem involves permutations (order matters) or combinations (order does not matter). 2) Calculate the number of possible permutations using factorial notation: P(n, k) = n! / (n - k)! where n is the total number of items and k is the number of selected items. 3) Calculate combinations using the formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!) for selection without regard to order. 4) Apply these calculations to the specific context of the problem, considering any restrictions or special conditions that affect the counts. 5) Sum the relevant counts if the problem requires totaling multiple possibilities. 6) Use principles of inclusion-exclusion to account for overlapping cases where applicable. 7) Verify the calculations by cross-checking with alternative methods or by considering small cases manually. Key insights: Clear distinction between permutation and combination problems is crucial. Factorials and binomial coefficients are essential tools in counting problems."
